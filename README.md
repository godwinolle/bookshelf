Functional Website: [Book Shelf](https://book-shelf-ab269.web.app)

This project is a personal book shelf that holds books that users plan on reading, are reading, or have read that they'd like to mark down for a specific reason.

I enjoyed working on this project and I love working with React and Firebase.
