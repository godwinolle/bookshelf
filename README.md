# Book Shelf ðŸ“š

First off, I would like to thank you for taking the time to review my work, and I hope there aren't any errors!

This project is a personal book shelf that holds books that users plan on reading, are reading, or have read that they'd like to mark down for a specific reason.

I enjoyed working on this project and I love working with React and Firebase.
